Work Showcase Webpage

As I begin a journey in web development, a great first step is creating an app that showcases my work- beginning to end. This was the first page I've created from scratch, and as such, I ran into many issues, a couple of which I was not able to solve. However, I believe this to be a great starting point that I can add to/ fix/ upgrade as my skills become more honed. 

Some of the things I am proud of about this page: Icons and hover effects look chic, the scheme/ colors look nice and pop, the superimposed text on the images looks great, and I was able to get all of the anchors/ links working (there are placeholders for resume and future projects).

Some of the issues I ran into that I wasn't able to solve YET: formatting/ manipulating images to appear in a polished layout, and modifying the page to be viewed on multiple screen sizes. 

I used the internet resource W3schools to learn some of the effects used on this page. I also received some help for an hour from a tutor Sachin, Thanks Sachin.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them✅
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section✅
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications✅
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application 
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others ✅
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application✅ 
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport❌

```
